    	-> cathegorize then prdiect is bad bacause paramters dont match the less likely a words occurrence is the mor important it is for cathegorization
        -> no unkown words but unkown n-grams
        -> log list shlould be better when representing cathegories than statistics
        -> cathegories are only based on last words (is this good or bad???)
        -> maybe use cathegories from n-gramms and also add a bais classifier and just add that as a liner smoothing parameter for the class
